# PageLoader

Simple and clean solution for page loader using javascript and css animations. 

It works by displaying a loader when `beforeunload` window event fires and then also displays a loader when the window event `load` fires, that is when the requested page loads. This gives the impression to the user that the loading transition was seamless.
